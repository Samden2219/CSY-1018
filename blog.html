        	<p>I started doing my assingnment for 15 days straight.I took atleast five days for each topic.At first I started with my homepage.i wanted to make a section from which it can direct me to different pages.So,by using menu bar i was able to make my homepage simple and easy. <img src="home.jpg" alt="homepage"></p>
            </div>
        	
        	<div class="blog-item2"><h1>Day6-10</h1>
        	       <p>After completing My Homepage, i decided to make my portfolio and contact page. firstly i made portfolio page with same background as homepage. i also included menu bar in both portfolio and contact page.The next thing to do was to fill the pages with content. I kept a placeholder for image. and had a little introduction about myself.<br>Ater completion of Portfolio page i moved on to contact page where i kept a simple form in which when clicked submit button it leads to gmail. <img src="portfolio.jpg" alt="portfolio page"></p>

        	<div class="blog-item3"><h1>Day11-15</h1>
        	                <p> It took me 5 days to complete to complete blog and site-report page. It took me 15 days to complete all my assignment.Firstly i decided to make blog then site-report.Blog and site-report both were given same layout. Since the university had gievn us a task to make Blog and Site-report pages using column, I used grid.<img src="blog.jpg" alt="blogpage"></p>
